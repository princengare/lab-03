## Lab Question Answers

Question 1: Why are RESTful APIs scalable?

Answer: RESTful APIs are scalable because they are stateless. This means that the server does not need to remember anything about the client. This allows the server to handle multiple requests at the same time. It also allows more than one server to handle requests.


Question 2: According to the definition of "resources" provided in the AWS article above, What are the resources the mail server is providing to clients?

Answer: the mail is providing mail entries to clients.


Question 3: What is one common REST Method not used in our mail server? How could we extend our mail server to use this method?

Answer: We didn't use PUT. We could extend our mail server to use PUT by adding a new method that would allow us to update a mail entry.
